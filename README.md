# Sorting Visualizer

At this point, most people have seen those YouTube videos of the sorting
algorithms moving the bars around so you get to see the how they work. This is
basically that. Currently, the program works via a command line interface
whereby you select the algorithm you want and the number of elements to sort.
The algorithms currently supported are the following:

- Bogo sort
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
